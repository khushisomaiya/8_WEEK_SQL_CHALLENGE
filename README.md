# 8_WEEK_SQL_CHALLENGE

The **8-Week SQL Challenge** is sourced from the website [8weeksqlchallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) and created by Danny Ma. The challenge is designed to help individuals improve their SQL skills over 8 weeks by solving a variety of interesting problems and building real-world SQL solutions.

## My Approach
To tackle the challenge effectively, I will follow a structured process each week:

1. **Schema Creation:** I will start by creating a schema file that defines the database structure (tables, relationships, constraints, etc.).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Next, I will create a file dedicated to performing exploratory data analysis, which will help in understanding the dataset and the types of queries required.
3. **Solution Files:** For each week's questions, I will write one or more SQL solution files. These files will contain the SQL queries to solve the given problems.
4. **Weekly Learnings:** At the end of each week, I will list the key things I’ve learned during that week’s challenge. This will include any new SQL techniques, optimizations, or database concepts that I discovered.

## Why I Took This Challenge
I took on the 8-Week SQL Challenge to significantly improve my SQL skills. This challenge will push me to work with complex queries, better understand database design, and learn to optimize my SQL solutions for real-world scenarios.

## Tools Used
I am using MySQL as the database management system (DBMS) to complete the challenges. All of my solutions will be written and executed using MySQL, which allows me to practice working with SQL in a widely-used relational database system.
