# Week 2: Pizza Runner

## Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza are consumed daily worldwide? Inspired by this, Danny started Pizza Runner, a pizza delivery service with a twist. He recruited runners to deliver fresh pizza from his house and built a mobile app for customers to place orders. Now, he's looking to optimize operations and needs help cleaning and analyzing his data.

## Data Provided
Danny has provided the pizza_runner database with the following key tables:

1. runners: Tracks the registration dates of runners.
2. customer_orders: Records customer pizza orders, including pizza types, exclusions, and extras (needs data cleaning).
3. runner_orders: Details about orders assigned to runners, including pickup time, delivery distance, and duration (check for data issues).
4. pizza_names: Lists available pizzas (currently Meat Lovers and Vegetarian).
5. pizza_recipes: Shows the standard set of toppings for each pizza.
6. pizza_toppings: Contains names of pizza toppings with IDs.
